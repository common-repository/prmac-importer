=== prMac WordPress Import ===
Requires at least: 2.7
Tested up to: 5.2.2
Stable tag: 3.0.1

Imports prMac releases into your WordPress blog. Releases can be imported as live posts or as drafts, depending on your settings. The plugin can be set to automatically import posts, or when you run it from the WordPress admin panel (whichever works best for you).


== Installation ==

To Install:

1. Copy the 'prmac-importer' folder into your plugins folder (located at wp-content/plugins/).
2. Activate it in the Plugins page in the WordPress admin.
	
After activating, open the 'prMac Importer' page under Settings. You will need to set your agency code, and you can now set any relevant options. If you chose to use the automatic import mechanism, new releases will be imported within 15 minutes of their being published. You can always do a manual import by going to Posts > prMac Importer.
